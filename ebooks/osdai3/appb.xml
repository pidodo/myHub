 00001    * conformance to Standard C for Minix to take advantage of.  If so, the
 00002    * symbol _ANSI is defined (as 31459).  Otherwise _ANSI is not defined
 00003    * here, but it may be defined by applications that want to bend the rules.
 00004    * The magic number in the definition is to inhibit unnecessary bending
 00005    * of the rules.  (For consistency with the new '#ifdef _ANSI" tests in
 00006    * the headers, _ANSI should really be defined as nothing, but that would
 00007    * break many library routines that use "#if _ANSI".)
