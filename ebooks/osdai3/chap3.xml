One of the main functions of an operating system is to control all the computer's I/O (Input/Output) devices. It must issue commands to the devices, catch interrupts, and handle errors. It should also provide an interface between the devices and the rest of the system that is simple and easy to use. To the extent possible, the interface should be the same for all devices (device independence). The I/O code represents a significant fraction of the total operating system. Thus to really understand what an operating system does, you have to understand how I/O works. How the operating system manages I/O is the main subject of this chapter.
